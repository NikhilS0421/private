                    <h3>The Day We Met</h3>
                    <p class="date">April 15, 2019</p>
                    <p>It was a sunny morning and the first day of my new school when I saw you for the first time, and from that moment, you became my crush. Every day, I watched you and fell more in love with you, but it was hard for me to express my feelings because of my appearance and my introverted, shy nature. Still, I enjoyed looking at you.

                        I know it was one-sided love, and I tried many times to talk to you and gather enough courage to tell you my feelings. You might have known this already, but I want to tell you again because our love story is very different. In 11th grade, I saw every emotion of yours ‚Äî your happy face, your angry face, and even your sad and crying face. My love for you grew stronger with each passing day. I even walked with you just to get a chance to reach out and express my feelings, but I could never gather the courage to do so.
                        
                        Then came the time when we were separated by the pandemic, and later, by destiny. That was the saddest part of my life. I even tried to contact you, but you didn‚Äôt reply to my messages. And that‚Äôs how we met ‚Äî or perhaps, how I met you, my love.

                    <h3>Our First chat or a gift for me by god </h3>
                    <p class="date">April 27, 2023</p>
                    <p>After a long 3-year gap, somehow, I got your Snapchat, and it felt like a gift from God to me. I got my hope back.
                        We started chatting, and I got to know more and more about you, which made me fall for you even deeper. Then we had our first fight because you misunderstood one of my messages. But that was just the beginning of our love journey.
                        
                        We chatted all day and night, often until 2 a.m., and you laughed so much. I still remember the day you sent me a voice note for the first time ‚Äî oh my God, that sweet voice! It was the first time I realized how cute and lovely your voice is.
                        
                        You tested me with your questions, and then, without even seeing my photo, you decided to give me a chance. After 15‚Äì16 days, we finally proposed to each other.

                    <h3>Special Day </h3>
                    <p class="date">May 18, 2023</p>
                    <p> This day is very special to me because it‚Äôs the day we officially became a couple. After that, we shared our phone numbers and started talking. We even fixed a time ‚Äî 3 p.m. every day ‚Äî for our video calls.

                        I still remember you were at your bua's house, sitting on a sofa, and you got ready for our first video call. You looked so, so pretty, my little princess. We talked for only an hour that day, but at night, we used to chat the whole night. I fell for you so hard from that moment that I can‚Äôt even explain it to you.
                        
                        After that, we finally met each other in person after a month.

                    <h3>Our First Date </h3>
                    <p class="date">3 July, 2023</p>
                    <P>3rd July ‚Äî the day finally came when we were going to meet each other. This day is very special to me. We decided to spend our first date at a temple under Lord Shiva to receive his blessings.
                        You wore a light green suit, and you looked soooooooo beautiful that day. I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at you; it was like I had turned into a stone statue. I prayed for you and for our better future together.
                        
                        That day, we spent only 2 to 3 hours together, but those 2‚Äì3 hours were the loveliest moments of my entire life. The smile I had after we got home stayed with me the whole night, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about you.

                    <h3>First Trip </h3>
                    <p class="date">December 9, 2023</p>
                    <p>Those two nights and three days were the most beautiful and unforgettable days of my life. During that time, we lived together and spent every moment side by side. We watched romantic movies, shared meals, explored the market, and just enjoyed being in each other‚Äôs company.

                        At night, we cuddled, holding each other close. I still remember the warmth and comfort of those moments ‚Äî it felt like the world outside didn‚Äôt exist, and all that mattered was us. Right now, I wish I could hold you again, cuddle you tight, and never let go. I love you so much, jaan.
                        
                        Those days made us realize how perfect we are for each other. It became clear that we could spend our entire lives together, supporting and loving one another. From that moment on, our bond grew even stronger, and our love for each other deepened with every passing day.
                        
                        But after coming home, I felt a heaviness in my heart. My mood was completely off because I missed you so much. I missed your presence, your smile, your voice, and the way you made everything feel complete. Being apart from you was harder than I could have imagined, and every moment felt incomplete without you by my side.
                        
                        You‚Äôve become the most important part of my life, and those three days together will always be etched in my heart as the sweetest memory. I can‚Äôt wait for the day when we can create more moments like that and spend every day of our lives together. .</p>
